# Felt-teacher
A platform that helps schools employ qualified teachers easily
# What the Platform will do?
Making refined and qualified teachers available to all schools in Nigeria is our priority. We intend to create a platform that links teachers to schools in the country. ONLY qualified teachers are to be found on our platform because series of tests will be conducted to test teachers' quality. Our platform also creates availabilty for teachers with more than one area of specialization to also participate. Both schools and teachers are to benefit from this platform we intend to create in the sense that the connection between schools and teachers will be just  "a click away".
